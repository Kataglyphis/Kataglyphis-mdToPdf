# Motivation

## Why this talk?

### Building a personal blog that scales with your projects

- One place to present projects, notes and demos
- Content stays portable: Markdown in Git
- Output is not just “a website”: slides + PDFs too

## The problem

- Docs drift away from code
- Publishing is friction (tools differ per OS)
- Content is trapped in one platform

## The goal

- One source of truth (Markdown)
- Reproducible builds (same output everywhere)
- Easy to share: web + PDF

## Markdown-first content

- Fast to write, easy to review (diffs)
- Reusable across formats
- Long-term ownership: text files, no lock-in

## Why Flutter/Dart? [@flutterdart]

- One UI codebase for Web/Desktop/Mobile
- Great for polished UI and consistent design
- Plays well as a frontend for Rust projects [@jotrockenmitlockenrepo]

## What you’ll see today

- The content workflow (Markdown $\rightarrow$ output)
- The reproducible build pipeline (Docker)
- A quick demo + the main takeaways

<!-- # How to get started

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules git@github.com:Kataglyphis/\
jotrockenmitlocken.git
```

## Conclusion

- And the answer is...
- $f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^\infty\frac{f^{(n)}(a)}{n!}(x-a)^n$ [@school] -->
